# TensorFlow-Keras-Dogs

In this project, we use TensorFlow, Keras, and transfer learning to train a model that can identify breeds of dogs from their pictures. We will use the Stanford Dogs dataset for training our model available at: http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs
For transfer learning, we will use the EfficientNetV2 model: https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/EfficientNetV2B0 

This notebook is designed to run in Google Colab, an online Jupyter Notebook that provides free access to GPUs. Running it on your local machine will require setting up a TensorFlow environment. If you choose to do so, ensure you have a GPU in your machine, as neural networks can take a long time to run.
